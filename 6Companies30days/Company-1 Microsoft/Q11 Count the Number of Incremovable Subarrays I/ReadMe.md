Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays I : 
You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums.

A subarray of nums is called incremovable if nums becomes strictly increasing on removing the subarray. For example, the subarray [3, 4] is an incremovable subarray of [5, 3, 4, 6, 7] because removing this subarray changes the array [5, 3, 4, 6, 7] to [5, 6, 7] which is strictly increasing.

Return the total number of incremovable subarrays of nums.

Note that an empty array is considered strictly increasing.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 10
Explanation: The 10 incremovable subarrays are: [1], [2], [3], [4], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,2,3], [2,3,4], and [1,2,3,4], because on removing any one of these subarrays nums becomes strictly increasing. Note that you cannot select an empty subarray.
